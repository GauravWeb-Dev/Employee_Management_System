# Employee_Management_System
A web-based Employee Management System built with Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage employee records, including adding, updating, viewing, and deleting data. The system uses JDBC and Servlets for backend operations and SQL for data storage. Future enhancements include integrating Spring Boot.
